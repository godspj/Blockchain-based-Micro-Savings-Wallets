# 🌟 Blockchain-based Micro-Savings Wallets

Welcome to an innovative solution for financial inclusion! This project enables users to create micro-savings wallets on the Stacks blockchain, allowing even the smallest deposits to earn interest through automated integration with DeFi protocols. It solves the real-world problem of unbanked or underbanked individuals who can't access interest-bearing savings accounts due to high fees, minimum balances, or lack of infrastructure. By pooling micro-deposits and leveraging DeFi, users can grow their savings securely and transparently.

## ✨ Features

💰 Create personal micro-savings wallets with no minimum deposit
📈 Earn interest on small amounts via automated DeFi pooling (e.g., yield farming or lending protocols)
🔄 Automatic interest compounding and distribution
🏦 Easy deposits and withdrawals in STX or BTC micro-amounts
🎯 Set savings goals with progress tracking and rewards
🔒 Secure ownership and fraud prevention through blockchain immutability
📊 Dashboard-like queries for balance, interest earned, and pool performance

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Savers (Users)**

- Call `create-wallet` to set up your personal savings wallet.
- Deposit funds using `deposit-funds` with the amount in STX (micro-amounts welcome!).
- Set a savings goal via `set-goal` to track progress and unlock bonuses.
- Funds are automatically pooled into DeFi protocols for interest earning.
- Check your balance and interest with `get-wallet-details`.
- Withdraw anytime using `withdraw-funds`, including accrued interest.

**For Verifiers or Auditors**

- Use `verify-ownership` to confirm wallet control.
- Query pool performance with `get-pool-stats` for transparency.

That's it! Your micro-savings grow passively while remaining under your control.
